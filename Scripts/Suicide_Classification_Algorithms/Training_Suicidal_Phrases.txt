I'm still suicidal
I think about suicide
I actually have thoughts of suicide
I'd be dead
if I died
I tried to commit suicide
I'm becoming more suicidal
I would blow my fucking brains out
I should commit suicide
drive me to suicide
I wish I was dead
I don't want to live
I have had suicidal thoughts
I just don't want to live
I think about killing myself
as well as being suicidal, I'm
I'm hearing voices. They're of my former best friends and they're telling me to kill myself
I use my depression for satire jokes, such as 'joking' about killing myself
I do want to kill myself
I've had more intense suicidal ideation before
if I just kicked the bucket tonight
I just bring myself to end it
I want to kill myself
I just have no motivation left, nothing to live for
I think about suicide
I don't want this fucking life anymore
I have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts
I still want to die
I wanted to kill myself
suicide is the right answer for me
I just tried to cut my throat
i'm trying to kill myself
I was so excited about the prospect of death
it's easier for me to kill myself
I'm wrong for wanting to punch my own ticket
I just don't want to live anymore
I want to die
a noose around my neck
my suicide plan
I'm just going to kill myself
I've come to commiting suicide
I dont see the point in living
I want to end it
I still feel like blowing my brains out
I could end it
I could hang myself
I don't want to exist
