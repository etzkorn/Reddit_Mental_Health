I didn't want to kill myself
Since then I've had more nights where I fell asleep wishing I wouldn't wake up than with a smile on my face.
I have come close to killing myself
when I was in high school, I made a goodbye tape; a cassette tape of me basically explaining why I was going to kill myself.
I attempted suicide
I tried suiciding twice in my life
I tried Strattera, and it made me feel like a zombie, null off creativity and suicidal
i was suicidal and decided i was going to kill myself
